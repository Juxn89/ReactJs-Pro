# CalendarApp - Progressive Web App
## Making a PWA
### Description
Starting with Create React App 4, you can add a src/service-worker.js file to your project to use the built-in support for Workbox's InjectManifest plugin, which will compile your service worker and inject into it a list of URLs to precache.

If you start a new project using one of the PWA custom templates, you'll get a src/service-worker.js file that serves as a good starting point for an offline-first service worker:

```npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa```

The TypeScript equivalent is:

```npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa-typescript```
